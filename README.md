## Problem Statement

In the modern healthcare system, it can be difficult to diagnose diseases early without proper tools and resources. Patients may describe symptoms vaguely or partially, making accurate diagnosis a challenge. There's a need for an intelligent system that takes multiple symptoms as input and predicts the most probable disease based on historical data.

---

## Objectives

- Build a predictive model using Machine Learning algorithms.
- Accept up to 10â€“17 symptoms as user input.
- Predict the most probable disease.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for interaction.
- Implement both **Flask** and **FastAPI** as deployment options.

---

## Proposed Solution

1. Preprocess the dataset by encoding categorical values.
2. Train the model using either:
   - Logistic Regression (Flask)
   - Random Forest Classifier (FastAPI)
3. Save the trained model using `pickle`.
4. Use a web framework to take user input and display the prediction.
5. Deploy the model locally using Flask/FastAPI and HTML forms.

---

## Architecture

The architecture of the Disease Classification System is designed to be modular and scalable. At the frontend, a user-friendly HTML form collects multiple symptoms as input from the user. These inputs are sent to the backend, which can be either a Flask or FastAPI server, depending on the implementation used. The backend handles preprocessing tasks such as encoding the symptoms into a machine-readable format using techniques like Label Encoding or OneHotEncoding. Once preprocessed, the input is passed to a trained Machine Learning modelâ€”Logistic Regression in the Flask version and Random Forest in the FastAPI versionâ€”which predicts the most likely disease based on the input symptoms. The prediction is then returned to the frontend and displayed in a clean and readable format. This entire system is powered by Python, scikit-learn, and pickle files used to store the trained models and encoders, making it efficient and ready for quick deployment.

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahalakshmi100/Disease-Classification-System.git
cd Disease-Classification-System/Deployment
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Pre-trained Model Files:
The following files are already included in the repository, so you do not need to retrain the model:

model.pkl â†’ Flask API trained model

disease_model.pkl â†’ FastAPI trained model

label_encoder.pkl â†’ Label encoder used for preprocessing in Flask API

---

## How to Run
### Fast API: 
```bash
python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
```
### Flask API:
```bash
python app.py
```

---

## Model Overview
**Dataset:** Symptom-Disease dataset containing multiple symptom columns and one target (Disease).
**Flask:** Trained using Logistic Regression with Label Encoding.
**FastAPI:** Trained using Random Forest with OneHotEncoding.
**Storage:** Trained models saved using pickle for reuse in APIs.

---

## Features
-Accepts multiple symptoms from the user.
-Predicts the disease instantly.
-User-friendly and clean UI using HTML templates.
-Two API versions: Flask (simple) and FastAPI (modern & scalable).

---

## Sample Use-Case
1. A user selects symptoms like:
Symptom_1: Itching
Symptom_2: Fatigue
...
2. Backend processes the input and makes predictions.
3. Output: Predicted disease such as Fungal Infection, Diabetes, etc.

## Future Scope
-Add confidence score or percentage with each prediction.
-Suggest treatments or nearby doctors based on the prediction.
-Create user login to track patient history.
-Deploy as a full-stack web or mobile application.
